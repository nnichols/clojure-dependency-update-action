# Clojure Dependency Update Action

A simple GitHub action to create Pull Requests for your out-of-date dependencies in clojure projects.
This action can automatically update the following dependency files:

- [deps.edn](https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha)
- [shadow-cljs.edn](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs)
- [project.clj](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen)
- [build.boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot)
- [pom.xml](https://github.com/apache/maven)

This action uses [antq](https://github.com/liquidz/antq) to check dependencies.

## Sample Usage

### Basic

```yml
name: Clojure Dependency Checking

    - name: Check deps
      uses: nnichols/clojure-dependency-update-action@v4
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}
```

### Advanced

```yml

- `directories`: Directories to search for project files in. Defaults to the root of the repository. See [antq-action](https://github.com/liquidz/antq-action#inputs) for more information.
- `skips`: Build tools/files to skip by default. Defaults to an empty list. See [antq-action](https://github.com/liquidz/antq-action#inputs) for more information.
